#####This is client for GeoNames.

Methods for client defined in GeoNames\ClientInterface and must be implemented in GeoNames\Client.

All implemented methods should be marked as FINAL to make them visible on frontend.
They would be added automatically so you don't need to change any html or js code.
To controll method parameters use PHPDoc to define type of param and requireness.
All this stuff would be taken on fly and update your html.
